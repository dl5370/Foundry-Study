warning: package `aws-smithy-runtime v1.9.6` in Cargo.lock is yanked in registry `crates-io`, consider running without --locked
warning: Patch `rexpect v0.6.2 (https://github.com/rust-cli/rexpect?rev=2ed0b1898d7edaf6a85bedbae71a01cc578958fc#2ed0b189)` was not used in the crate graph.
Check that the patched package version and available features are compatible
with the dependency requirements. If the patch has a different version from
what is locked in the Cargo.lock file, run `cargo update` to use the new
version. This may also occur with an optional dependency that is not enabled.
